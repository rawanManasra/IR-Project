# IR-Project

1. to run the program you need to run passageSearchDemo.java in the default package.


2. the index already exists in the project, in a directory named by "index", so no need to do indexing again. 
though, if you still want to do the indexing from the start please uncomment line 63 in passageSearchDemo.java file.

3. the database nfL6.json saved in the main directory, but it does not appear in the git because i ignored it, because it's too large. 
to run the program from the start:
you need to change the path of nfl6.json file to the appropriate one - in line 21 in readYahooDataBase.java in com.jsonReading package.

4. lucene libraries are in lib directory, also gson.jar


5. the finalEval.txt questions are in the main directory.
