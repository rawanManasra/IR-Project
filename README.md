1. to run the program you need to run passageSearchDemo.java in the default package.


2. the index already exists in the project, in a directory named by "index", so no need to do indexing again. 
though, if you still want to do the indexing from the start please uncomment line 63 in passageSearchDemo.java file.


3. lucene libraries are in lib directory, also json.


4. the finalEval.txt questions are in the main directory.


5. the output.json also saved in the main directory.
